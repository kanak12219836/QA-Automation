# QA-Automation
# QA Automation Project

## Overview
This project implements an automated Question–Answering (QA) system that processes user queries and generates accurate, context-aware responses using structured workflows and language models. The system is designed to reduce manual effort, improve response consistency, and enable scalable knowledge access.

## Features
- Automated question processing  
- Context-aware answer generation  
- Modular and extensible architecture  
- Easy integration with datasets or documents  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Prompt-based QA logic  
- File and data handling  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd QA-Automation

	2.	Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	Run the application

python main.py

Input
	•	User questions
	•	Knowledge base or reference documents

Output
	•	Automated answers generated by the QA system

Use Cases
	•	Customer support automation
	•	Knowledge base querying
	•	Academic and research assistance
	•	Enterprise information retrieval

Conclusion

This QA automation project demonstrates how automated systems can efficiently handle user queries by combining structured logic with language model capabilities, enabling scalable and reliable question–answering solutions..
